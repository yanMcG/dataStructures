                                                        1. Hashing Fundamentals (5 Marks)
                                                    Define the following terms and concepts:
*from dermots notes*
---------------------------------------------------------


1.1. Hash Function
a hash function is a mapping technique that converts a key(string usually) to a value.
so you associate a key with data, the key is what used to store it. this is benificial
for organisation and finding.

invoked the hashcode method, you can inherit it hwoever its not great, it carries out a 
mathmatical operation of data. the input is the data, and output is a number whihc isan array index
thanks to this you dont get too many collisions, still possible theoritically however
---------------------------------------------------------


1.2. Hash Table
The hash table is what stores the key and value pair. in terms of performance
it depends on the size of the array, its easy to find values however you can 
have thousands of values and each of those values have a unique key/ID, 
which can take up alot of storage.

the keys override the equals and hashcode method. implements data as a pair.
---------------------------------------------------------


1.3. Collision in a hash table
due to each value having a unique key identifier, Collisions are minimised when
the data strcture is developed well as each key is unique, values can
be the same, you can have matching values but each key/ID is unique

how cllisions are normall solved,
each array element is not a reference to the single piece of data,
its actually like a linked list. its actually te head of a linked list.
so if you do get a collision you dynamically add a element to the linked list.
---------------------------------------------------------


1.4. Load Factor
iteration is not as fast when it comes to hash tables, its onyl fast with insetion and removal.
hash maps, developed well are faster than tree maps. theres no control over the order that the elementa are stored in
with the way the structure inters the elements. how it iterates is from top to bottom.


Definition: the load factor α = n / m, where n = number of stored entries and m = number of buckets (table capacity).
---------------------------------------------------------


1.5. Open addressing
for open addressing in relation to hash maps, its a collision resolution technique where basically all inputs are 
directyl stored in the tabe array, so when a key is put in a occupied slot, a sequence is used to find an
alternative slot instead of placing the key externally of the list.
