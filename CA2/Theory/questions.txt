                                                        1. Hashing Fundamentals (5 Marks)
                                                    Define the following terms and concepts:
***dermots videos***
---------------------------------------------------------


1.1. Hash Function
a hash function is a mapping technique that converts a key(string usually) to a value.
so you associate a key with data, the key is what used to store it. this is benificial
for organisation and finding.

invoked the hashcode method, you can inherit it hwoever its not great, it carries out a 
mathmatical operation of data. the input is the data, and output is a number whihc isan array index
thanks to this you dont get too many collisions, still possible theoritically however
---------------------------------------------------------


1.2. Hash Table
The hash table is what stores the key and value pair. in terms of performance
it depends on the size of the array, its easy to find values however you can 
have thousands of values and each of those values have a unique key/ID, 
which can take up alot of storage.

the keys override the equals and hashcode method. implements data as a pair.
---------------------------------------------------------


1.3. Collision in a hash table
due to each value having a unique key identifier, Collisions are minimised when
the data strcture is developed well as each key is unique, values can
be the same, you can have matching values but each key/ID is unique

how cllisions are normall solved,
each array element is not a reference to the single piece of data,
its actually like a linked list. its actually te head of a linked list.
so if you do get a collision you dynamically add a element to the linked list.
---------------------------------------------------------


1.4. Load Factor
iteration is not as fast when it comes to hash tables, its onyl fast with insetion and removal.
hash maps, developed well are faster than tree maps. theres no control over the order that the elementa are stored in
with the way the structure inters the elements. how it iterates is from top to bottom.


Definition: the load factor α = n / m, where n = number of stored entries and m = number of buckets (table capacity).
---------------------------------------------------------


1.5. Open addressing
for open addressing in relation to hash maps, its a collision resolution technique where basically all inputs are 
directyl stored in the tabe array, so when a key is put in a occupied slot, a sequence is used to find an
alternative slot instead of placing the key externally of the list.

                                            2. Compare Hashing with Tree-based Structures: (5 Marks)

2.1. Discuss how hash-based data structures (like hash tables) differ from tree-based data
structures (like red-black trees or AVL trees).


        so the difference i suppose comes down to how well the hash table is structurd, as a badly designed hashmap can be 
        outperformec by a tree map in terms of speed, but in most cases a hash map is really fast at processes of adding and removing.
        iteration within a hashmap compared to trees performance is more poor however.  

        One of the biggist differences beween these two types is that trees have a organised/ordered storage unlike hashmaps.
        so in terms of speed of processes trees have a garunteed O(log n) unlike hashmaps where their performance may be better on average
        but worst case scenario O(n) meaning the hash maps are less predictable.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each in terms of time complexity for
operations such as insert, delete, and search?

        tree-based structures:
            Advantages
            Tree-based can be far more predictable compared to hash maps
            Maintains sorted order for efficient rangefinding, predecessor/successos and iteration.

            Disadvantages
            Higher memory cost per element
            has slightly worse cache when compared to a well designed hash map structure 

        Hash Maps:

        Advantages
            Very fast average-case lookups and updates.
            Low per‑operation cost; good cache locality (especially open addressing).

        Disadvantages
            No ordering cannot do range queries or ordered iteration as fast as trees.
            deletions can be tricky for open addressing.
            order of insertions does not matter.

5. Briefly describe how Question 4 (LRU cache) can be updated to support concurrency.
(5 Marks)
Consider thread safety, locking mechanisms, and concurrent data structures.


thread safety:
    make sure each get/put operation is atomic 
    gets muust return correct value and access order without races
    a put must replace automatically the least recentyl used value in the cache
    i could implement a lock free and wait free desing into the data strucutre. 


locking mechnasims:
    implement:
        coarse grained locking:
            lock the enitre data strucutre
            simple to implement
            low parallelsim as only 1 thread can access data at a time

        fine grained locking:
            multiple locks
            has better performance
            hardert o implement and risks deadlocks


data structures:

    implementing a concurrent deign comes with soem flaws. desing issues to be considered are:
        coreectness
        granulairty of locks
        deadlockk avoidance
        lock fee and wait free desing
        memory consistency
        memory reclamation
        fairness and starvation
        scaalibility
